# Other Media Charlton App

Requirements:

:heavy_check_mark: 1. Utilize RxJava for data processing and handling.

:heavy_check_mark: 2. Implement Room for local data storage.

:heavy_check_mark: 3. Integrate Retrofit for the network requests and API interactions

:heavy_check_mark: 4. Feel free to use the favorite libs to handle the other project requirements like loading image, date and etc etc.

:heavy_check_mark: 5. Do not use Android Jetpack compose

:heavy_check_mark: 6. Commit the code in a Git repository.

:heavy_check_mark: 7. Map the two call to actions buttons with the object “firstCallToAction” and “secondCallToAction”


## My Approach
- Worked on making sure the main objectives were completed, used RxJava to process data and saved to local database.
- If I had more time, I would've worked on dependency injection to include adequate testing.
- Future work: Left the unused data models in-case to include additional match data elements for future features.
